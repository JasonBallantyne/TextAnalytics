# Carrying out the basic steps of Text Preprocessing

### Tasks Performed:
1. **Text Normalisation**
- Converting all letters to lower or upper case
- Converting numbers into words or removing numbers
- Removing punctuations, accent marks and other diacritics
- Removing white spaces
- Expanding abbreviations
- Removing stop words, sparse terms, and particular words
- Text canonicalization

2. **Tokenisation**: The process of splitting the given text into smaller pieces called tokens. Words, numbers, punctuation marks, and others can be considered as tokens.

3. **Stop word removal**: The most common words in a language such as “the”, “a”, “on”, “is”, “all”. These words do not carry important meaning and are usually removed from the text.

4. **Stemming**: The process of reducing words to their word stem, base or root form (for example, books — book, looked — look)

5. **Lemmatization**: Used to reduce inflectional forms to a common base form. As opposed to stemming, lemmatization does not simply chop off inflections. Instead it uses lexical knowledge bases to get the correct base forms of words.

6. **Part of speech tagging (POS)**: Aims to assign parts of speech to each word of a given text (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and others) based on its definition and its context.

7. **Entity extraction**: The process of identifying the conceptual identities behind the words rather than the dictionary knowledge.
